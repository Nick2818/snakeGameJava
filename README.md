# Snake Game Java
## The snake is controlled with the keyboard arrows. Initially, the snake has 5 joints + head.
## If the apple collides with the head, we increase the number of joints of the snake.
## If the game is finished(collision with borders or itself), the "Game Over" message is displayed in the middle of the board.
